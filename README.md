# Cluster Analysis Project

This project performs a cluster analysis on a dataset to identify patterns and groupings among data points using K-means clustering. The analysis includes preprocessing, determining the optimal number of clusters, applying clustering, and interpreting the results.

## Project Steps

### Task 1: Data Preprocessing
- Handle any missing values in the dataset.
- Scale the features using **StandardScaler** or **MinMaxScaler**, as K-means is sensitive to feature scales.
- Remove unnecessary columns (e.g., index or identifier columns) that do not contribute to clustering.

### Task 2: Determine the Optimal Number of Clusters
- Use the **Elbow Method** to find the optimal number of clusters.
- Calculate the **Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)** for different numbers of clusters.
- Visualize WCSS vs. the number of clusters using a line plot to identify the "elbow" point.

### Task 3: K-means Clustering
- Apply **K-means clustering** using the optimal number of clusters obtained from the Elbow method.
- Assign cluster labels to each data point.
- Add a new column in the dataset containing the cluster labels.

### Task 4: Cluster Analysis
- Analyze each cluster by comparing the **mean values of features** within clusters.
- Visualize clusters using:
  - **Pairplots** for selected features.
  - **Scatterplots** to understand the separation between clusters.

### Task 5: Interpretation
- Interpret the characteristics of each cluster.
  - Example: Identify which cluster has the highest alcohol content or the most intense color.
- Suggest potential **names or categories** for each cluster based on observed patterns.
